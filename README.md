# LFE language support in Atom

Cloned from [enriquefernandez/language-lisp](https://github.com/enriquefernandez/language-lisp) in order
to add support for Lisp Flavored Erlang (LFE).  This is a work-in-progress, therefore some effort to properly customize
this package for Atom might still be needed.  I plan to publish to the atom repository sometime in April 2017

For proper Lisp indentation and better editing experience this package should be used in conjunction with some advanced editing tool:
- [Parinfer](https://atom.io/packages/parinfer) (suitable for beginners and gurus alike; automatically manages parentheses based on indentation)
- [Paredit](https://atom.io/packages/lisp-paredit) (recommended for advanced users; manipulates code as abstract syntax tree)
